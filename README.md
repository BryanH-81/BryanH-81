# Hey, I’m Bryan

I’m a self-taught full-stack developer, solo founder, and US Army Veteran building AI-powered tools that solve real problems for underserved industries.

I focus on fast iteration, clean code, and practical MVPs that work in the real world — not just pitch decks.

## Currently Building

🚀 **[Chefluent](https://chefluent.com)** – An AI-powered platform that helps restaurants instantly generate branded, engaging social media posts from real menu items and events.

Built with:
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS  
- Supabase (auth + database)  
- OpenAI (GPT-4o) + Stripe integration  

Chefluent is in pre-launch beta with a mobile-friendly UI, modular prompt system, and tiered subscriptions. I’m actively testing with local restaurants and refining the core product.

💬 Message me at **bryan@chefluent.com** if you want a demo or to join the beta.
