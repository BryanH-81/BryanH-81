# Hey, I’m Bryan

I’m an independent researcher, systems thinker, and U.S. Army Veteran working on methodological tools for analyzing complex explanatory claims—especially where theory, bookkeeping, and narrative tend to blur together.

I’m interested in where explanations *actually* do their work, and where they quietly outsource it to assumptions.

### CEDA — Cosmological Explanation Diagnostic Audit

CEDA is a **diagnostic framework** for early-universe cosmology. It is **not** a cosmological model, **not** a mechanism, and **not** an alternative to inflation or ΛCDM.

Its purpose is narrow and deliberate:  
to audit early-universe proposals for **explanatory provenance** under strict, conservation-honest accounting.

CEDA asks a simple but unforgiving question:

> Where does the claimed physical behavior actually come from—dynamics, or description?

The framework provides:

- A standardized **Model Card** for making assumptions explicit  
- A structured **stress-test suite** that separates genuine dynamics from descriptive reweighting  
- Clear diagnostic classifications (mechanism, reinterpretation, descriptive instability, underspecification)  
- A formal **failure catalogue** naming recurring conceptual pathologies without rhetoric  

CEDA emerged from internal null results demonstrating that horizon-mediated accessibility reconfiguration, when treated honestly as bookkeeping, does **not** generically produce inflation-like behavior. Rather than rescuing the idea, the framework formalizes the diagnostic lesson.

The result is an audit tool designed to clarify—not compete with—successful cosmological mechanisms.

**Status:** For external review

## Current Focus

- Conservation-honest bookkeeping in effective descriptions  
- Separation of genuine dynamics from descriptive artifacts  
- Diagnosing inflation-mimicking constructions without appealing to observational fit  
- Clarifying why successful inflationary models require additional structure  
- Building reusable diagnostic language for referees, reviewers, and model builders

- Nonprofit operations and compliance leadership (501(c)(3) treasurer)  
- Longstanding interest in physics, philosophy of science, and explanation under constraint  
- Strong bias toward disciplined scope, explicit assumptions, and falsifiable structure
